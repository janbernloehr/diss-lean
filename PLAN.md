# Implementation plan

## Milestones

1. **Sequence spaces:** finite truncations, density, weighted coefficients,
   bounded Fourier multipliers, convolution estimates.
2. **Fourier realization:** identify the `p = 2` model with periodic `L²`, prove
   the periodic-distribution interpretation, and fix period-one/period-two and
   signed-component conventions.
3. **First spectral milestone:** domain inclusion, differentiation and potential
   multiplication, the free Zakharov–Shabat resolvent, and compactness.
4. **General analysis:** audit exact convolution, discrete Hilbert transform,
   contour integration, infinite product, and compact operator dependencies.
5. **Spectral data:** localization, multiplicities, finite-dimensional reduction,
   and locally uniform sequence asymptotics (Chapter 1).
6. **Classical dependencies:** formalize the necessary results from reference
   [23], Grébert–Kappeler, *The defocusing NLS equation and its normal form*.
   Conditional development may use explicit hypotheses, but final main theorems
   must instantiate them with proofs.
7. **Coordinates:** actions, angle branches, analytic rectangular coordinates,
   canonical relations, and the precise conclusions of Theorem 14.1.
8. **Applications:** frequencies and Hamiltonian (Theorems 18.1–18.3), dynamics
   (Theorem 18.5), and Sobolev estimates (Theorems 23.1–23.4).

## Statement audit

- Preserve `1 < p < ∞` versus `1 < p ≤ 2` hypotheses. Do not assume that the
  Birkhoff map is surjective for `p > 2`.
- Treat analyticity on a positive cone using an ambient open extension.
- Encode locally uniform sequence estimates with neighborhood norm bounds.
- Renormalized quantities must be defined by convergent expressions before
  proving identities involving subtraction on the classical domain.
- Preserve the smooth-approximation notion of rough solutions in Section 18.
- The Hessian display on printed page 12 requires correction: the preceding
  expansion for `H` gives `4 - 2 δ_nm`; `-2 δ_nm` is the corresponding Hessian
  of the renormalized Hamiltonian at zero.

## Completion policy

Every implemented theorem must compile without `sorry`, `admit`, or project
axioms. Main-result completion also requires an audit of transitive axioms.
Dependencies and source-page references should be recorded as each theorem is
introduced. Definition-only stubs do not count as proved results.

## Immediate next proof targets

The Fourier-side convolution multiplication estimate
`FL^p × FL^{1,p} → FL^p` is now proved for every finite `p≥1`, with a constant
depending only on `p`. The scalar and pair domain inclusions, differentiation,
and the two-component operator are also proved, with explicit period-two signs
and maximum-pair-norm bounds. Both signed free modes have eigenvalue `π n`.

The free resolvent away from `πℤ` is now constructed as a bounded inverse into the
one-derivative domain, with both inverse identities and a spectral-gap bound on
the base space. Compactness follows from operator-norm convergence of finite
Fourier cutoffs. The signed-mode formulas and resolvent identity are also proved.

The next targets are the `FL^p → FL^1` estimates from Lemma 3.2(ii–iii), closedness
and relative perturbation estimates, and the general-potential resolvent via a
Neumann series. Physical-space interpretation, period-one embedding, and
comparison with the dissertation's pair norm are separate proof obligations.
