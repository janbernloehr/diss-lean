## Current mathematical milestone

For every `1 ≤ p < ∞`, we have constructed the coefficient-space operator

`operator hp φ : Domain p →L[ℂ] PairSpace p`

with `Domain p = ScalarDomain p × ScalarDomain p` and
`ScalarDomain p = WeightedCoeff (Weight.sobolev 1) p`. The domain inclusion is
injective, contractive, and has dense range. With the maximum norm on pairs,

`‖operator hp φ f‖ ≤ (π + C_p * ‖φ‖) * ‖f‖`.

Here `C_p` is the norm of the reciprocal weight in the Hölder conjugate space.
Potential multiplication is the previously proved convolution construction,
which establishes the coefficient estimate underlying Appendix A, Lemma A.8.

Both scalar components use modes `exp(i π n x)` on the period-two circle.
Differentiation has symbol `i π n`; the free operator therefore has symbols
`-π n` and `+π n`. The dissertation's signed modes use scalar frequencies `-n`
and `n`, respectively. Their included vectors are proved nonzero and satisfy
`L₀ eₙ⁻ = π n eₙ⁻` and `L₀ eₙ⁺ = π n eₙ⁺`.

The domain and operator follow Chapter 1, §3, printed page 23; the signed-mode
convention follows §2, equation (1.2). The spectral pencil is explicitly a map
from the domain to the base space. The unbounded realization is now proved
closed, as detailed below. The physical Fourier/distribution realization remains
unproved.
The dissertation's pair norm is not used for these numerical bounds; its
comparison with the chosen maximum norm is a separate proof obligation.

For every `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞` and every `z ∉ πℤ`, the free equation is now a
continuous linear equivalence between the one-derivative domain and base space.
The inverse `freeResolventToDomain z hz` satisfies both inverse identities.
Writing `δ(z) = dist(z, πℤ) > 0`, we prove

- `‖freeResolvent z hz‖ ≤ 1 / δ(z)` on the base space;
- `‖freeResolventToDomain z hz‖ ≤ 1 / δ(z) + (1 + ‖z‖ / δ(z)) / π`;
- `R₀(z) - R₀(w) = (w - z) R₀(z) R₀(w)`;
- compactness of `freeResolvent z hz` on the base space.

The compactness proof constructs finite Fourier cutoffs and proves convergence
in operator norm from uniform decay of the reciprocal symbol. This establishes
the coefficient-space content of Chapter 1, Lemma 3.2(i), printed page 24, and
extends it to all Banach exponents. It does not assert compactness of the inverse
as a map into the stronger domain norm.

For finite `p≥1`, the free resolvent now also maps into `FL^1`. Let `B_p(z)` be
`freeL1Bound p hp z hz`: the maximum of the conjugate-space norms of the two
reciprocal symbols. These are finite by the reciprocal Sobolev-weight estimate.
Hölder and convolution give

`‖Φ R₀(z)‖ ≤ B_p(z) * ‖φ‖`.

Under the explicit sufficient condition `B_p(z) * ‖φ‖ < 1`, the geometric series
converges in operator norm and defines the correction `Q = (1 - Φ R₀(z))⁻¹`.
We prove the factorization `z - L(φ) = (1 - Φ R₀(z)) (z - L₀)` and construct
`Rφ = R₀(z) Q`, with both inverse identities on their correctly typed spaces.
The inverse takes values in the one-derivative domain, is compact on the base
space, and satisfies

`‖Rφ‖ ≤ δ(z)⁻¹ / (1 - B_p(z) * ‖φ‖)`.

This establishes the coefficient-space Neumann construction used before
Corollary 3.3, printed pages 23–24. For `p=1`, `B_1(z) ≤ 1 / |Im z|`, so
`|Im z| > ‖φ‖` suffices. Every `l1` potential therefore has an admissible
parameter; the proof chooses `z = i (‖φ‖ + 1)`.

For every finite `p≥1`, uniform high-imaginary-part regions are now established.
Define `U_p(N)` as the conjugate-space norm of the explicit envelope

`n ↦ min (1 / (N + 1)) (3 / (1 + abs(n)))`.

We prove `U_p(N) → 0` and `B_p(z) ≤ U_p(N)` whenever `abs(Im z) ≥ N + 1`,
uniformly in `Re z`. The proof shifts frequencies by `floor(Re z / π)` and
uses dominated convergence at finite conjugate exponents; the infinite conjugate
exponent uses the uniform height cap directly.

Consequently, every bounded set of potentials has a common height above which
the Neumann condition holds, for both signs of the imaginary part. Every
potential in `PairSpace p`, for any `1 ≤ p < ∞`, has a two-sided inverse into
the one-derivative domain whose base-space realization is compact. The theorem
`exists_compact_inverse` states this without a smallness hypothesis on the
potential.

These are qualitative uniform regions with a concrete envelope, rather than
the sharper numerical rates and vertical-strip bounds in Lemma 3.2(ii–iii).
Those constants remain to be proved. Analytic dependence and spectral
discreteness are now established below.

The actual unbounded realization is now defined as

`unboundedOperator hp φ : PairSpace p →ₗ.[ℂ] PairSpace p`.

Its domain is exactly the range of `domainInclusion`, independently of the
potential, and its evaluation agrees with `operator hp φ`. It is densely defined
and closed for every finite Banach exponent. For any constructed two-sided
inverse `R` at `z`, its graph is characterized by the base-space equation

`domainInclusion (R (z • x - y)) = x`.

Continuity of this equation proves graph closedness. The accompanying limit
lemma shows that if included domain vectors converge to `x` and their operator
images converge to `y`, then `x` has a domain representative with image `y`.
This establishes the coefficient-space closedness assertion on printed page 23.

The full resolvent set `resolventSet hp φ` is now defined by bijectivity of the
spectral pencil, with no exclusion of the free lattice. Normalizing the pencil
by the fixed free inverse at `i` gives an endomorphism of `PairSpace p`;
bijectivity of the pencil is equivalent to invertibility of this endomorphism.
Banach-algebra inversion then defines `resolventToDomain hp φ z` and its included
base-space version `resolvent hp φ z`. Both functions are extended by zero outside
the resolvent set; inverse identities and analyticity are asserted only on it.

The joint domain `{(φ,z) | z ∈ resolventSet hp φ}` is open. On that domain,
the resolvent is jointly complex analytic in `(φ,z)`, in operator norm, both
into the one-derivative domain and into the base space. In particular it is
analytic in `z` for each fixed potential, as in Corollary 3.3, printed page 24.
It agrees with the constructive Neumann inverse wherever the Neumann condition
holds, so every potential has a nonempty resolvent set. The full base-space
resolvent is compact by factoring through the fixed compact free resolvent.
These results establish compactness and analytic dependence throughout the full
coefficient-space resolvent set; the corollary's specific numerical region
remains an open proof obligation.

The periodic coefficient-space spectrum is now defined as the complement of
the full resolvent set. At any fixed resolvent point `w`, we prove, for `z ≠ w`,

`z ∈ periodicSpectrum hp φ ↔ (w-z)⁻¹ ∈ spectrum ℂ (resolvent hp φ w)`.

The generic compact-operator argument is proved using Riesz's lemma on the
successive finite-dimensional spans of eigenvectors. Infinitely many distinct
eigenvalues bounded away from zero would produce bounded vectors whose compact
images stay a fixed distance apart. Together with mathlib's Fredholm alternative,
this gives finiteness of the compact spectrum away from zero, with no
self-adjointness hypothesis. Nonzero compact-operator eigenspaces are also
proved finite dimensional by compactness of their identity map.

The spectral transformation implies that every bounded part of the periodic
spectrum is finite. The spectrum is closed and has the discrete subspace topology;
every spectral point has a nonzero eigenvector in the one-derivative domain.
The domain eigenspaces embed into nonzero eigenspaces of the compact resolvent,
so their geometric multiplicities are finite. This proves the coefficient-space
discreteness conclusion of Corollary 3.3. Generalized eigenspaces and algebraic
multiplicities are now constructed below. Spectral projections and quantitative
localization remain separate proof obligations.

The general inverse difference formula is now proved for simultaneous changes
of potential and spectral parameter. It specializes to

`Rφ(z) - Rφ(w) = (w-z) Rφ(z) Rφ(w)`

and commutation of the resolvents. Varying the potential at a fixed parameter gives

`Rφ(z) - Rψ(z) = Rφ(z) Φ(φ-ψ) R_D,ψ(z)`.

Here `R_D` takes values in the one-derivative domain, so each potential operator
is applied on its actual domain. Differentiating the inverse equations proves
the explicit joint complex Fréchet derivative in operator norm. Applied to an
increment `(δφ,δz)` and a base vector `a`, it is

`Rφ(z) (Φ(δφ) (R_D,φ(z) a)) - δz • Rφ(z) (Rφ(z) a)`.

The domain-valued derivative is proved as well. In particular,
`∂z Rφ(z) = -Rφ(z)²` and `Dφ Rφ(z)[ψ] = Rφ(z) Φ(ψ) R_D,φ(z)`.
These formulas are available through both derivative predicates and mathlib's
`deriv`/`fderiv`. All derivative assertions are restricted to the open full
resolvent domain. The zero-potential inverse agrees with the free inverse, and
the pre-Neumann identity on printed page 23,
`Rφ(z) (I - Φ R₀(z)) = R₀(z)`, now holds whenever both resolvents exist,
without imposing the sufficient Neumann smallness condition.

Periodic root spaces are now defined directly from the unbounded operator:

`G₀(z) = {0}`, `Gₙ₊₁(z) = {domainInclusion f | (z-L)f ∈ Gₙ(z)}`.

The definition enforces one-derivative domain membership at each step, and
contains no choice of reference parameter. Its first level is the included
ordinary eigenspace. For every resolvent point `w`, we prove

`Gₙ(z) = ker (I + (z-w) Rφ(w))ⁿ`.

Equivalently, these are the generalized eigenspaces at `-1` of the compact
operator `(z-w) Rφ(w)`. This representation remains valid at `z=w`.
The full root space is the increasing union of all finite levels.

The generic compact-operator proof establishes finite-dimensional generalized
eigenspaces and finite stabilization at every nonzero value. Finite-level
dimensionality follows by removing the constant term from a shifted operator
power; stabilization follows from Riesz vectors in successive kernels and
compactness. Consequently, each periodic full root space is finite dimensional,
closed in the base space, and reached at a finite level. Its dimension defines
`periodicAlgebraicMultiplicity hp φ z`, which is positive exactly on the periodic
spectrum and zero exactly on the resolvent set.

Identification of these multiplicities with ranks of Riesz spectral projections
or zero orders of characteristic functions, along with spectral decompositions,
remains to be proved.

The weighted topology is induced by the weighted `lp` norm. A type synonym
prevents accidental inheritance of pointwise convergence from raw sequences.

## Verification

Run `./scripts/check.sh` to build, check public-API examples, and audit transitive
axioms. The current audit covers 623 declarations under `NLS`, including generated
definitions and instances. Only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`
are allowed.

The examples exercise multiplication at `p=1,2,3`, convolution and differentiation
at `p=∞`, domain density at `p=1`, the operator bound at `p=3`, the frequency-shift
sign, both signed free spectral equations, and nonzero off-diagonal coupling.
Resolvent checks use the concrete parameter `z=i`, exercise both inverse identities,
the bounds, compactness at `p=1,3,∞`, cutoff convergence, signed-mode denominators,
and the resolvent identity. Perturbation checks cover the Hölder and convolution
bounds at `p=3`, convergence of the Neumann series, and a concrete nonzero
potential with both entries equal to one at `z=2i`: both inverse identities,
compactness, and the norm bound are checked. Uniform-estimate checks exercise
`p=1,3`, a parameter with a far-negative real part, one height for a whole norm
ball, and compact inverse existence for an arbitrary `p=3` potential. Closed-operator
checks cover `p=1,3`, domain density, evaluation on included vectors, and preservation
of the graph under sequential base-norm limits. Analytic-resolvent checks cover
`p=1,3`, the open joint domain, nonempty resolvent sets, joint and separate
analyticity, both full inverse identities, compactness, and agreement with the
concrete nonzero Neumann example at `z=2i`. Spectral checks cover `p=1,3`,
finiteness in balls and arbitrary bounded sets, the discrete topology, domain
eigenvectors, finite geometric multiplicity, the free Fourier eigenvalues, and
the spectral transformation at the nonzero test potential. Calculus checks
cover `p=1,3`, general differences, commutation, joint derivatives into both
spaces, the potential derivative, the spectral derivative sign on the zero
Fourier mode at `z=i`, and the pre-Neumann identity for the nonzero potential.
Root-space checks cover `p=1,3`, finite stabilization, finite dimensionality,
compatibility with ordinary eigenspaces, the bounded representation for arbitrary
reference points, positive/zero algebraic multiplicity, and a two-dimensional
Jordan block distinguishing generalized from ordinary eigenvectors. No admission
or extra project axiom is used by the library.

## Next milestones

1. Construct spectral projections and decompositions, and relate projection ranks
   to the defined algebraic multiplicities.
2. Prove the sharper numerical rates and vertical-strip estimates from Lemma
   3.2(ii–iii), then develop spectral localization.
3. Prove the periodic Fourier/distribution realization, period-one embedding,
   pair-norm comparison, and compatibility with physical-space multiplication.

Spectral localization, classical Birkhoff prerequisites, and the main dissertation
theorems remain unimplemented. Further sequence-space work includes
symmetric cutoff convenience functions, embeddings between regularities, and the full
range of Young inequalities beyond the `l1`-factor case.
