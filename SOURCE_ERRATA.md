## Lemma 26.2: sign of the higher Hamiltonian

Source: [dissertation, Lemma 26.2](https://janbernloehr.de/Download/fs16/diss.pdf#page=113).
The statement and proof contain the factor `(-1)^(m+1) 2^m H_(2m+1)`.
However, [Theorem 24.1, equation (5.4)](https://janbernloehr.de/Download/fs16/diss.pdf#page=107)
states `sum_n J_(n,k) = H_k / 2^(k-1)`. At `k = 2m+1` this gives

```
8^m sum_n J_(n,2m+1) = 2^m H_(2m+1).
```

The additional sign agrees at odd `m` and disagrees at even `m` unless
`H_(2m+1) = 0`. The repository retains the physical Hamiltonians from
Appendix H; it does not absorb this sign into their definition.

Formal results:

- `eight_pow_mul_tsum_realHigherActions` proves the positive trace equality
  on the real H^m source space.
- `printed_even_trace_identity_iff_zero` proves the precise obstruction
  to the printed equality at every even order.
- `classicalNLSHamiltonian_constant_one_five` independently checks the
  Appendix H recurrence: the constant real-type potential `(1,1)` has
  physical `H_5 = 2`.
- `sourceWeightedAction_summable_and_le_half_mass` proves absolute
  summability and the trace-consistent estimate
  `sum_n ⟨2nπ⟩^(2m) |I_n| ≤ C(P,m) ‖ψ‖²/2 + 2^m H_(2m+1)`, where
  `C(P,m) = (1+16π)^(2m) (1+P)^(4m)` and `P` is the norm of an exact
  π-normalized H¹ realization of the period-one source potential.
- `sourceWeightedAction_le_mass` weakens the half-mass factor to the
  full squared pair norm appearing in the printed remainder.

This establishes the corrected estimate and identifies the error in the
printed proof equality. It does not constitute a formal counterexample
to the entire printed inequality, whose positive remainder must also be
accounted for. The literal signed statement of Lemma 26.2 is not claimed
as a proved result.
